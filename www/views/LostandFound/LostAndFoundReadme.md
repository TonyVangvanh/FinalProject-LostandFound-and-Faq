## Lost and Found Folder views 

I have used Ionicframework, https://www.codementor.io/, http://angular-ui.github.io for resource.

Lost and Found provides users with the ability to locally distribute and search for any lost/found item.

## Some of the features lost and found 
Owner have a limited time to pick up item
Users can select a radio button
Users can post up 
Users can provide contact information
Notify users of claimed property

We implemented a search and share social media, but unfortuanately the share social didn't work. Firebase works fine and 
are able to read data from Firebase.
